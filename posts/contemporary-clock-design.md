Saw [this][original] on [Reddit][source], now I'm considering this as my next project to do.
But as some of the commenters have pointed out, the OCD inside me will twitch every time the hands
are converging, but not quite. Like 11:58.

Neat design though.

In the comments, I came across this youtube. These ideas to liven your space are simple yet functional. I have a few empty glass bottles laying around, so I'm definitely giving the second idea a try.
