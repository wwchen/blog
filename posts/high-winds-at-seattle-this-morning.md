Crazy weather in Seattle this morning: I hopped on 520 close to noon, and not long after I was stuck in standstill.
Initially I thought it was boat traffic, but two emergency cars blared their sirens all the way to the front, so
I changed my hypothesis to an accident.

Half an hour later, I'm still sitting duck. Many cars started to turn around but I got out my car and ran to the front.
This is what I saw:

The wind was so strong and the tides were so high, water was washing over the bridge, and it is a hazard to drive
on the bidge. As a safety concern, WADOT closed down 520.
Later in the day, KOMO News reported some pretty [serious damage][komo] caused by the high winds

Crazy. o.o
