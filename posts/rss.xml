      <description>&lt;p&gt;Crazy weather in Seattle this morning: I hopped on 520 close to noon, and not long after I was stuck in standstill.
Initially I thought it was boat traffic, but two emergency cars blared their sirens all the way to the front, so
I changed my hypothesis to an accident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Half an hour later, I&amp;#39;m still sitting duck. Many cars started to turn around but I got out my car and ran to the front.
This is what I saw:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/sh/2fnroo8xhxgsj4h/d5qWtDLffW/2013-11-02%2011.30.08.jpg" alt="high rides with water washing over 520"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wind was so strong and the tides were so high, water was washing over the bridge, and it is a hazard to drive
on the bidge. As a safety concern, WADOT closed down 520.
Later in the day, KOMO News reported some pretty &lt;a href="http://www.komonews.com/news/local/Novembers-first-storm-ravages-Western-Washington-230347191.html"&gt;serious damage&lt;/a&gt; caused by the high winds&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crazy. o.o&lt;/p&gt;
