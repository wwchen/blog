Chicken Noodle Soup
===================

[Source](http://budgetbytes.blogspot.com/2012/02/chicken-noodle-soup-910-recipe-091.html)

Ingredients
===========
  * carrots
  * celery
  * chicken breast
  * egg noodles
  * dried basil, parsley, thyme; bay leaf, pepper, salt
  * garlic, yellow onion
  * olive oil

### Instructions
  1.  Dice the onion and mince the garlic. Begin cooking them in a large pot over medium heat with 2
      Tbsp of olive oil.
  1.  While the onion and garlic are sauteing, wash and slice the carrots and celery. Add them to
      the pot and continue to saute.
  1.  Pull the skin and any excess fat from the chicken breasts. Add the breasts to the pot along
      with the bay leaf, basil, parsley, thyme, and black pepper. Add eight cups of water. Cover, 
      bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for one hour. Make sure
      the pot continues to simmer for the whole hour. If the heat is turned down too low and it is
      not bubbling away, the chicken will not shred easily.
  1.  After an hour of simmering, remove the chicken from the pot. Using two forks, pull the meat 
      from the bone and shred it slightly. Season the broth with salt. Begin with one teaspoon and
      add more to your liking. I used one tablespoon total (or three teaspoons). The flavor of the 
      broth will really pop once the salt is added.
  1.  Add the noodles to the pot, turn the heat up to high, and boil the noodles until tender 
      (about 7 minutes). Return the shredded chicken to the pot, add two more cups of water (to 
      account for evaporation and absorption from the noodles). Taste and season again with salt if
      needed (I didn't need to). Serve hot!
