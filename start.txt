  * 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
  * 2 packages chicken tenders, 1 1/2 to 2 pounds
  * 1 tablespoon coriander, a palm full
  * 2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme leaves, 5 to 6 sprigs
  * Salt and freshly ground black pepper
  * 1 large onion, quartered and thinly sliced
  * 1 large bell pepper, quartered and thinly sliced
  * 1 jalapeno, seeded and thinly sliced
  * 1 (28-ounce) can fire roasted diced tomatoes
  * 1 quart chicken stock
  * 1 bag white corn tortilla chips
  * 1 cup shredded pepper Jack or sharp white Cheddar
  * 1 ripe avocado, diced
  * 1 lime, juiced
  * 4 scallions, chopped
  * Handful fresh cilantro leaves or fresh flat-leaf parsley, chopped
== Instructions ==
Heat a large skillet with extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan, over medium-high heat. Add chicken, begin to brown 4 minutes, add coriander, thyme, salt and pepper, to taste, onions, bell pepper and jalapeno, season with salt and pepper, to taste. Cook 8 to 10 minutes, stirring frequently. Add tomatoes and stock, heat through.

While the soup is working, lightly crush some tortilla chips and divide among 4 bowls. You need a couple of handfuls per bowl. Top the chips with a little cheese. Toss the avocado with lime juice. Top the chips with ladles of soup. Garnish soup with avocado, scallions and cilantro or parsley.

==== Chicken Noodle Soup ====
  * [[http://budgetbytes.blogspot.com/2012/02/chicken-noodle-soup-910-recipe-091.html|Source]]
== Ingredients ==
  * carrots
  * celery
  * chicken breast
  * egg noodles 
  * dried basil, parsley, thyme; bay leaf, pepper, salt
  * garlic, yellow onion
  * olive oil
== Instructions ==
  - Dice the onion and mince the garlic. Begin cooking them in a large pot over medium heat with 2 Tbsp of olive oil.
  - While the onion and garlic are sauteing, wash and slice the carrots and celery. Add them to the pot and continue to saute.
  - Pull the skin and any excess fat from the chicken breasts. Add the breasts to the pot along with the bay leaf, basil, parsley, thyme, and black pepper. Add eight cups of water. Cover, bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for one hour. Make sure the pot continues to simmer for the whole hour. If the heat is turned down too low and it is not bubbling away, the chicken will not shred easily.
  - After an hour of simmering, remove the chicken from the pot. Using two forks, pull the meat from the bone and shred it slightly. Season the broth with salt. Begin with one teaspoon and add more to your liking. I used one tablespoon total (or three teaspoons). The flavor of the broth will really pop once the salt is added.
  - Add the noodles to the pot, turn the heat up to high, and boil the noodles until tender (about 7 minutes). Return the shredded chicken to the pot, add two more cups of water (to account for evaporation and absorption from the noodles). Taste and season again with salt if needed (I didn't need to). Serve hot!
